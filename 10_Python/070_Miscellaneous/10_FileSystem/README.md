## Example Description
This example shows how to interact with the file system.<br>
The implementation uses the built-in library functions to create a new folder and a new file inside it. After rebooting the device, since the file exists, its content will be printed.<br>
If the define `ERASE_FOLDER` is `True` the new folder will be deleted at the startup.<br>
The current implementation also shows how easy it is to change the working directory and how to list files.
