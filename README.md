# Ganiemede.E12
Public Repo for Ganimede.E12 board. 

# Repo Description
This repo contains some getting started material and some example for using Ganimede.E12 with Python, C/C++ and Javascript.

# What Ganimede.E12 is?
The Ganimede.E12 is a fancy development board based on ESP8266 SoC from EspressIf and, more specifically, on the ESP-12 SoM developed by AI-Thinker.
The idea behind Ganimede.E12 (and more in general to all the Ganimede family) is that I started to be bored of soldering, breadboarding and, more in general, to have messy connection between my development board and the sensor and actuators I needed for my experiments.
Additionally, after the experience with Mercury System, I decided to not to do again such a crazy things in which I had to make all the HW and SW, as it required literally hundreds of days and it's not sustainable (and if if it would be, Anna would kill me). Moreover, I do love C, but I understond that this is not the same for everybody and is also a bit limiting, so welcome to Python and Javascript. Last but not least, I wanted to have something really cheap, that can be used by me, friends and (possibly) others.
So, in the end, Ganimede.E12 is a development board with the following characteristics:

1. It's based on ESP8266, 4MB Flash, Integrated USB and WiFi
2. It carries some sockets/connectors that allow to use well known standards (Mikroe MikroBUS, SeedStudio grove, others), so no more messy connections with sensor/actuators around your desk.
3. Can be programmed in C/C++, Python and Javascript
4. It's really cheap, target price is 15â‚¬
5. It's open hardware, I will share schematics and design files
6. It's really simple to use
